This strong foundation has become a hallmark of The Valleymen's sound, especially evident in the seamless harmonies that Bryan and Bennett sing together in most of their songs.

The Valleymen draws inspiration from a diverse array of artists, including Hippocampus, Flipturn, and Mt Joy. This unique blend of influences is the cornerstone of their style. It seamlessly merges modern indie vibes with classic rock/folk elements, creating a familiar and refreshingly new soundscape that resonates with a broad audience. Characterized by a passionate and liberated approach to music, The Valleymen create an immersive experience for their listeners.
